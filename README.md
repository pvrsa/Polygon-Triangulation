# Polygon-Triangulation
Implementing all the components required to triangulate a simple polygon 

The three algorithms to implement for triangulation of a simple polygon are:
    1> DCEL data structure to store polygon partitioning.
    2> Partitioning a polygon into y-monotone polygons.
    3> Triangulate each y-monotone polygon.
